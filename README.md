# 100-days-of-code

This is my attempt to get a working knowledge of Git while completing the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy.

For the time being I will use it to note down changes, amendments, or important things to remember.


### **Day 006**

Since this project is based on Reeborg's World maze puzzle, it would be nice to be able to implement the actual puzzle itself in code as well as the solution.

### **Day 032**

Gmail's security has been updated, so I haven't been able to check if this actually works. Need to sort out security settings to test.

###  **Day 033**

Another one which requires gmail to send emails. All other testing seems to show it working though.
