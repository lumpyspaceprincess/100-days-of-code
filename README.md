# 100-days-of-code

This is my attempt to get a working knowledge of Git while completing the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy.

For the time being I will use it to note down changes, amendments, or important things to remember.


### **Day 006**

Since this project is based on Reeborg's World maze puzzle, it would be nice to be able to implement the actual puzzle itself in code as well as the solution.

### **Day 032**

Gmail's security has been updated, so I haven't been able to check if this actually works. Need to sort out security settings to test.

###  **Day 033**

Another one which requires gmail to send emails. All other testing seems to show it working though.

###  **Day 039-40**

Infuriatingly, I'm unable to use both gmail AND sheety due to the sheety API's low free tier. So this project remains untestable until next month. Possibly need to set up Yahoo email address, might work in place of gmail.
